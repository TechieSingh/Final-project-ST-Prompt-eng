Biology Fundamentals

Cell Structure and Function

Cells are the basic units of life. All living organisms are composed of cells. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Prokaryotic cells (bacteria) lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells (plants, animals, fungi) have a nucleus and various organelles.

Key organelles:
- Nucleus: Contains DNA and controls cell activities
- Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP
- Chloroplasts: Site of photosynthesis in plant cells
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Protein and lipid synthesis
- Golgi Apparatus: Modifies and packages proteins
- Ribosomes: Protein synthesis

DNA and Genetics

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the genetic material that carries instructions for development, functioning, and reproduction.

DNA structure:
- Double helix shape
- Composed of nucleotides (A, T, G, C)
- Base pairing: A with T, G with C

Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins. The process of gene expression involves transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein).

Evolution

Evolution is the process by which species change over time through natural selection. Key concepts:
- Natural selection: Organisms with advantageous traits survive and reproduce
- Genetic variation: Differences in DNA among individuals
- Adaptation: Traits that help organisms survive in their environment
- Speciation: Formation of new species

Ecosystems

An ecosystem consists of living organisms and their physical environment. Components include:
- Producers: Plants that make food through photosynthesis
- Consumers: Animals that eat other organisms
- Decomposers: Organisms that break down dead matter
- Abiotic factors: Non-living components (water, soil, temperature)

Food chains and food webs show energy flow through ecosystems. Energy flows from producers to consumers, with only about 10% of energy transferred between trophic levels.
