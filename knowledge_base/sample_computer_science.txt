Computer Science Fundamentals

Programming Concepts

Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to execute. Key concepts include:

Variables: Storage locations for data values
Data Types: Categories of data (integers, strings, booleans, etc.)
Control Structures: Decision-making (if/else) and repetition (loops)
Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures for solving problems

Data Structures

Arrays/Lists: Ordered collections of elements
Stacks: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure
Queues: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure
Trees: Hierarchical data structures with nodes
Hash Tables: Key-value pairs for fast lookups

Algorithms

Common algorithm types:
- Sorting: Arranging data in order (bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort)
- Searching: Finding elements (linear search, binary search)
- Graph algorithms: Traversing networks (BFS, DFS)
- Dynamic programming: Solving problems by breaking into subproblems

Time Complexity: Measures how algorithm runtime grows with input size
Space Complexity: Measures memory usage of algorithms

Software Engineering

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. Requirements gathering
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Best Practices:
- Code documentation
- Version control (Git)
- Testing (unit tests, integration tests)
- Code reviews
- Agile methodologies

Database Systems

Databases store and manage data efficiently. Types:
- Relational databases: Structured data in tables (SQL)
- NoSQL databases: Flexible data models (MongoDB, Cassandra)

Key concepts:
- Tables: Collections of related data
- Primary keys: Unique identifiers
- Foreign keys: References to other tables
- Queries: Requests for data
- Transactions: Atomic operations
